    <h1 id="Noun"><u>Noun</u></h1>
  <p style="text-align: left;">A noun is a <a href="word.html">word</a> used to refer to people, animals, objects, substances, states, events and feelings. Nouns can be a subject or an object of a verb, can be modified by an adjective and can take an article or determiner.
<br>
    Nouns may be divided into two basic groups:<br>
    
    Countable Nouns have plural forms and Uncountable Nouns do not.<br>

  <p><h3>A pronoun is a word that substitutes a noun or noun phrase. Using a pronoun is a way of avoiding repetition of a noun; it is an economical way to make texts clearer and avoid the heaviness and dullness that results from repeating nouns and noun phrases, which can be seen in certain documents like legal texts where the repetition is sometimes required. Pronouns used to be considered as a single part of speech, and are still seen this way by some, but others consider that the different roles they play and the different types of them makes their nature more complex.
<br>
    There are a number of different kinds of pronouns in English.
    <br>


    TYPES OF PRONOUN:
    <br>
    <ol><li>Demonstrative Pronoun - this, that, these, those</li><br>
   <li> Personal Pronoun - I, you, he, she, etc..</li><br>
    <li>Possessive Pronoun - mine, yours, his, etc..</li><br>
    <li>Reflexive Pronoun - myself, yourself, etc..</li><br>
    <li>Interrogative Pronoun - who, what, where, etc..</li><br>

    <p><h3>Verbs are one of the major grammatical groups, and all sentences must contain one. Verbs refer to an action (do, break, walk, etc.) or a state (be, like, own).

      The verb tense shows the time of the action or state. Aspect shows whether the action or state is completed or not. Voice is used to show relationships between the action and the people affected by it. Mood shows the attitude of the speaker about the verb, whether it is a declaration or an order. Verbs can be affected by person and number to show agreement with the subject.</h3></p>
